// I tested this program by running it a multitude of times ensuring that each event could occur and that stats were being counted correctly. Also, by outputting the generated number, i ensured that the correct values were being assigned to the correct event
    // I looked to make sure for each function all of the different outcomes were possible
        // Testing:
                // 20 events possible
                // shot_outcomes -- was able to generate all the outcomes
                // get_foul_card -- was able to generate all the outcome
                // soccer_simulation -- gives correct output for event number
                // to ensure stats were correct, I outputted the stats after each event to ensure that the outcome was being counted in the correct spot before changing it back to only halfway through the game and at the end
// limitations -- it doesn't truly stimulate a real soccer game as there is no time delay in events, also all the odds are the same for both team. In reality, there is often a team that could be better than the other, where skill comes into play, and the events decided aren't by the 'roll of a dice'.



// Step 0. initialize and declare variables
// Team A and B counters -- score, fouls, number of shots
//Step 1. make function soccer_simulation -- generate random numbers[1,20] for number of events
//step 2. for each event ( iterate through ) generate from [1,6] for each event
    // step 2.1 use booleans for shot and set to true ( 1 = team A shot, 2 = team B shot)
        // step 2.10 make function shot_outcome
            //if true, generate [0,3] - ( 0 = goal , 1 = goalkeeper/defender saved, 2 = shot was off goal, 3 = shot was blocked by other player)
            // store outputs in counters
        // step 2.11 outout results
    //step 2.2 set booleans for true for foul if get 3 or 4( 3 = team B foul( Team A free kick) 4 = team A foul (Team B free kick))
        // step 2.20 use function shot_outcome
        // step 2.21 make function foul_card
            //generate [0,2] to give no card, yellowcard or red card respectively -- add to counter
        // step 2.22 output results
    //step 2.3 set booleans for foul close to goal and penalty kick if value is 5 or 6
        // step 2.30 use function shot_outcome
        // step 2.31 use function foul_card
        // step 2.32 output results
// step 3. after 10 events, print game stats ( current score, shots on goal, shots off goal, blocket shots, fouls, yellow cards, and red cards )
